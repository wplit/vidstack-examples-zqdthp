# Player: Web Components (Default Theme)

This example demonstrates setting up an audio and video layout by customizing the Default Theme
using Vidstack Player Web Components.

The Default Theme is best when you want to build your own player but you don't want to
design each component from zero. Our default styles have been built to be extremely easy to
customize! We provide the shell and base styles and you provide the content and customization.
